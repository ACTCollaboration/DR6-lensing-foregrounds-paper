\section{Introduction}

\section{Formalism and Methods}

\subsection{Quadratic Estimator}

\todo{use curved-sky equations?}

We reconstruct the lensing potential via the quadratic estimator 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\phi}_{\vecL} = \frac{1}{2} \Aphi_L \int \frac{\dx{^2\vecl}}{(2\pi)^2}  \frac{f_{\vecL,\vecl} T_{\vecl}T_{\vecL-\vecl}}{\Cltot{l}\Cltot{|\vecL-\vecl|}}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \Aphi_{\vecL} = \left[ \int \frac{\dx{^2\vecl}}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{f_{\vecL,\vecl}^2}{2\Cltot{l}\Cltot{|\vecL-\vecl|}} \right]^{-1}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    f_{\vecL,\vecl} = \tilde{C}_l\vecl.\vecL + \tilde{C}_{|\vecL-\vecl|}\vecL.|\vecL-\vecl|.
    \label{eq:fphi}
\end{equation}
Here $\tilde{C}_l$ is the lensed CMB temperature power spectrum, while $\Cltot{l}$ is the total observed CMB power spectrum (i.e. including noise).

The estimator has an $N^0$ bias, which is the expectation for a Gaussian field, that is equal to $A_{\vecL}$. 

\subsection{Foreground biases}\label{sec:fg_biases}

Foregrounds contaminate the temperature as 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta T(\vecl) = \DTcmb(\vecl) + \DTfg(\vecl)
\end{equation}
Denoting a symmetric quadratic estimator on two temperature maps $A$ and $B$ as $Q(T^A, T^B)$, the contamination of $C_L^{\hat{\phi}\hat{\phi}}$ is
\begin{align}
    \Delta \Clhatphi{L}
    &= 2\left<Q(\Tfg,\Tfg) \phi \right>_L\\
    &+ 4\left<Q(\Tfg, \Tcmb)Q(\Tfg, \Tcmb)\right>\\
    &+ \left<Q(\Tfg,\Tfg)Q(\Tfg,\Tfg)\right>
\end{align}
The first and second terms are known as the \emph{primary} and \emph{secondary} \emph{bispectrum} terms respectively (since they depend on bispectra involving $\Tfg$ and $\phi$), while the third term is known as the tripsectrum contribution, since it depends only on the trispectrum of $\Tfg$.

Given a simulation of $\Tfg$ and $\phi$, we can estimate these terms individually, and without noise from the primary CMB,  following \citet{Schaan_2019}. In this case the tripsectrum has an $N^0$ bias that we must subtract; this is given by
\begin{equation}
    N^{0,\mathrm{fg}}_{L} =  A_L^2 \int \frac{\dx{^2\vecl}}{(2\pi)^2}  \frac{f_{\vecL,\vecl}^2 C^{\mathrm{fg}}_l C^{\mathrm{fg}}_{|\vecL-\vecl|}}{2(C_l^{\mathrm{tot}}C_{|\vecL-\vecl|}^{\mathrm{tot}})^2}
    \label{eq:N0fg}
\end{equation}
Note that the integral here is the same as for $\Aphi_L$, but replacing $\Cltot{l}$ with $(\Cltot{l})^2 / \Clfg{l}$.

\subsection{Bias-hardened estimators}

In general a bias-hardened estimator for a field $x(\vecL)$ in the presence of a contaminant $y(\vecL)$ is 
\begin{equation}
    x_{\vecL} = \frac{\hat{x}_{\vecL}-A^x_{\vecL} R^{xy}_{\vecL}\hat{y}(\vecL)}{1-A^x_{\vecL}N^{y}_{\vecL} (R^{xy}_{\vecL})^2}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{x}(\vecL)$ is the non-hardened estimator,
\begin{equation}
    R_{\vecL}^{xy} = \int \frac{\dx{^2\vecl}}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{f^{y}_{\vecL,\vecl} f^{x}_{\vecL,\vecl}}{2\Cltot{l}\Cltot{|\vecL-\vecl|}}
\end{equation}
and $A^{x}_{\vecL}$ is the estimator normalization, given by $1/R_{\vecL}^{xx}$. Here $f^{x}$ and $f^{y}$ are functions which describe the mode-coupling induced by the fields $x$ and $y$. For lensing, this is given by \eqn{eq:fphi}, for point-sources, it is a constant. One can also harden against Poisson distributed sources with some (Fourier transformed) radial profile $u(\vecl)$, in this case, 
\begin{equation}
    f_{\vecl,\vecL-\vecl} = \frac{u(\vecl)u(\vecL-\vecl)}{u(\vecL)}
\end{equation}

There is a noise cost to doing bias-hardening, with the $N^0$ of the bias-hardened estimator given by
\begin{equation}
    N^{0,x,BH} = N^{0,x} / (1 - N^{0,x} N^{0,y} (R^{xy})^2)
\end{equation}

When computing the foreground tripsectrum contamination, we again need to subtract an $N^{0}$ contribution, which is a little more complex in the bias-hardened case, given by
\begin{equation}
    N^{0,\mathrm{fg,BH}} = 
\frac{
    N^{0,\mathrm{fg}} + (A^x)^2 (R^{xy}A^{y} - 2  R^{xy} A^{y}  R^{xy}_{\mathrm{fg}})}{\left[1 - A^x A^y (R^{xy})^2\right]^2}
\end{equation}
where $N^{0,\mathrm{fg}}$ is given by \eqn{eq:N0fg} (and is also equal to $(A^x_{\vecL})^2 / R^{xx,\mathrm{fg}}_{\vecL}$) and 
\begin{equation}
    R^{xy,\mathrm{fg}} = \int \frac{\dx{^2\vecl}}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{f^{y}_{\vecL,\vecl} f^{x}_{\vecL,\vecl} \Clfg{l}\Clfg{|\vecL-\vecl|}}{2\Cltot{l}\Cltot{|\vecL-\vecl|}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Frequency-cleaned, asymmetric and  symmetrised estimators}

Even for the temperature-only case, We need not use the same two maps in our quadratic estimator - we can also use two temperature maps which have had different levels of foreground cleaning applied, which can result in a better bias-variance trade-off than using the same (noisy) frequency-cleaned temperature map in both legs of the quadratic estimator. Indeed if just one of the maps has zero foreground contamination, we might expect the quadratic estimator to be unbiased by foregrounds (see \citealt{hu07, madhavacheril18, darwish21}).

Our quadratic estimators are not in general symmetric in their arguments i.e. $Q\left[X,Y\right]$ is not in general equal to $Q\left[Y,X\right]$, for $X\neq Y$. \citet{darwish21} therefore propose using a minimum-variance linear combination of the two estimators:
\begin{equation}
    \kappa_{\mathrm{sym}}(\vecL) = \bm{W}(\vecL) \begin{pmatrix}
    \kappa_{XY}(\vecL) \\
    \kappa_{YX}(\vecL)
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\bm{W}(\vecL)$ is some weight matrix. We define the matrix 
\begin{equation}
    \textbf{N}^0 = \begin{pmatrix}
N^{0,XYXY} & N^{0,XYYX} \\
N^{0,YXXY} & N^{0,YXYX}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $N^{0,ABCD}$ is the $N^0$ for the general case of the cross-correlation of $\kappa_{AB}$ and $\kappa_{CD}$, and is given by (see Toshiya's notes).

Then the normalized, minimum variance $\bm{W}(\vecL)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
W(\vecL) = \frac{\left(\textbf{N}^0\right)^{-1}}{|\textbf{N}^0|(N^{0,XYXY}-N^{0,YXYX})}
\end{equation}
(where we have used that $N^{0,XYYX}=N^{0,YXXY}$).

\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:sims}

Describe \cite{Sehgal_2010} and \cite{websky} simulations

\section{Simulation processing}

\subsection{Simulated ACT DR6 maps}

In order to generate realistic estimates of the contamination of the ACT DR6 lensing power spectrum due to extragalactic foregrounds, we need to perform some pre-processing of the microwave sky simulations described in \sect{sec:sims}. 
\todo{For now just describe the processing for the baseline result}
For each simulation, we use the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{We generate a total foreground map (for each frequency) by summing the contributions from the tSZ, kSZ, CIB and radio point-sources.}
\item{We then add a realization of the lensed (by the appropriate $\kappa$ field) CMB.}
\item{We then convolve with a Gaussian beam appropriate for the frequency (with full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) = 1.4 and 2.2 arcminutes for 90 and 145 GHZ respectively), and add a random  realization of the instrumental noise with a spatially varying variance appropriate for the white noise level (as estimated by ?) of the DR6 day+night coadded data. Note that this necessarily requires also applying the ACT DR6 mask.}
\item{We input these simulated maps to the matched-filter source and cluster finding algorithms implemented by \nemo^{\footenote{\url{https://nemo-sz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}}}\ \cite{Hilton_2021}. We firstly run nemo on each frequency in point-source finding mode with a $\snr>5$ threshold, which outputs a point-source catalog which can be used to generate a point-source model map.}
\item{We then run nemo in cluster-finding mode (jointly on the 90 and 150 GHz maps), passing the point-source catalog in the config file to be masked during cluster finding. This outputs a cluster catalog that can be used to generate a cluster model map.}
\end{enumerate}

For the baseline DR6 lensing analysis, point-source models are subtracted at the map level, while clusters are masked and inpainted. Since our foreground bais estimator is applied to foreground-only maps, we subtract from these our point-source model map, and mask the nemo clusters ((i.e. set the beamed foreground-only maps to zero) with the same 6 arcminute radius as used for the masking/inpainting on the real data. Given these foreground-only maps do not contain CMB and instrumental noise, we don't expect significant statistical anisotropy to be introduced by masking without inpainting. 

\subsection{Adding Planck high frequency and harmonic ILC}

As well as our baseline approach which uses only ACT maps, we investigate a frequency cleaning approach, for which it is useful to include high frequency data from Planck (353 and 545 GHz), where the CIB is brighter. To minimize the information on the primary CMB coming from Planck (i.e. to make this a mostly independent of Planck CMB lensing measurement), we do not include lower frequency Planck data. 

To simulate the Planck data, we generate the total foregrounds-only maps at the Planck frequencies, and apply a point-source flux threshold of 304 and 555 mJy to the 353 and 545 GHz channels respectively (taking these thresholds from Table 1 of  \citealt{ade16}). We apply the ACT DR6 analysis mask to isolate the same sky area for the ACT and Planck data. Note that for the S10 simulations, no 545 GHz data was generated, therefore we simply scale the 353 GHz CIB simulation using a spectrum \citep{madhavacheril20} 
\begin{equation}
    f_{\mathrm{CIB}}(\nu) \propto 
    \frac{\nu^{3+\beta}}{\exp{h\nu/k_B \Tcib-1}}
    \left(\frac{\dx{B}(\vu,T)}{\dx{T}}|_{T=\Tcmb} \right)^{-1}
    \label{eq:cib_spec}
\end{equation}
with $\beta = 1.2$, $\Tcib=24K$ and $B(\nu,T)$ is the Planck function. Note that the CIB does not exactly follow such a spectrum - the use of this rescaling is then a weakness of our S10 result, however, the \websky\ simulations do have a more realistic 545 GHz channel. As for the other foreground components, the tSZ can be accurately scaled to 545 GHz with a spectrum
\begin{equation}
    f_{\mathrm{tSZ}}  \propto 
    \frac{h \vu}{k_B \Tcmb} 
    \frac{e^{h\vu/k_B \Tcmb + 1}}{e^{h\vu/k_B \Tcmb-1}} - 4,
    \label{eq:tsz_spec}
\end{equation}
kSZ is frequency-independent in CMB units, and radio point-sources can be assumed to have negligble flux contribution at 545 GHz (can we cite something for this?)

We produce harmonic space linear combinations of the maps that i) minimize the variance of the outputs maps ii) additionally deproject one or more foreground components by assuming an $l$-independent spectrum for those foreground components. In our case, those foreground components are the CIB and tSZ, with spectra given by \eqn{eq:cib_spec} \& \eqn{eq:tsz_spec} respectively.

Again, we note that this assumption is only approximate in the case of the CIB. Minimizing the variance requires providing total power and cross-spectra for all the input maps; we construct these for frequencies $i$ and $j$ as
\begin{equation}
C_{l,ij}^{\mathrm{total}} = C_l^{\mathrm{cmb}} + C_{l,ij}^{\mathrm{fg}} + \delta_ij N_{l,\mathrm{i}}
\end{equation}
where $C_{l,ij}^{\mathrm{fg}}$ is the foreground (cross-)spectrum estimated from the simulation foreground-only maps, and $N_{l,\mathrm{i}}$ is the noise-only power spectrum, estimated from ACT DR6 noise simulations and the Planck noise-only simulations\footnote{available on NERSC at \url{/global/cfs/cdirs/cmb/data/planck2020}} provided with the NPIPE maps \citep{akrami20}, 

Note that since we do not use power spectra measured directly from simulated maps containing lensed CMB signal, we will not incur any \emph{ILC-bias}, which comes from the down-weighting of modes with high signal variance that can occur in an ILC (cite ilc bias). When generating ILC maps on the real DR6 data, we do use power spectra measured directly from the data, but apply aggressive smoothing to avoid this ILC bias. 

\section{Foreground biases to $C_L^{\kappa\kappa}$}

Below we present our predicted (from the sims) biases due to extragalactic foregrounds $\Delta \Clhatphi{\vecL}}$. We calculate this broadly following the methodology of \citet{Schaan_2019}, who outline how each of the terms: primary bispectrum, secondary bispectrum and trispectrum can be estimated from simulations without noise due to the CMB or instrument noise realisation. The total bias is then simply the sum of these terms.  

We estimate foreground biases for the temperature only case as well as for our \emph{MV} estimator, which the lensing power spectrum estimated from, $\hat{\phi}^{\mathrm{MV}}(\vecL)$, the reconstruction which uses both temperature and polarization data, given by a weighted sum of the reconstructions from all pairs $AB \in \left[TT,TE,TB,EE,EB\right]$:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\phi}^{\mathrm{MV}}(\vecL) = \sum_{AB} w_{AB} \hat{\phi}^{AB}(\vecL).
\end{equation}
We weight each $\hat{\phi}^{AB}(\vecL)$ by the inverse of the normalization (which is equivalent to it's response to lensing). The bias on the MV lensing power spectrum estimate is then \citep{darwish21}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    \Delta \CLhatphiX{MV} &= 
    \left[ (w_L^{TT})^2 \Delta \CLhatphiX{TTTT} \right.\\
 &+ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{XY \in (EE, BB, TE)} w_L^{TT} w_L^{XY} P^{TT}_L\\
 &+ \left. w_L^{TT}w_L^{TE} S^{TTTE}_L + w_L^{TE}w_L^{TE} S^{TETE}_L\\
 &+ \left. w_L^{TT}w_L^{TB} S^{TTTB}_L + w_L^{TB}w_L^{TB} S^{TBTB}_L
 \right].
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $\Delta \CLhatphiX{TTTT}$ is the bias on the temperature-only estimator, $P^{TT}_L$ is the primary bispectrum bias on the temperature-only estimator. There are additional secondary bispectrum terms $S^{TTTE}_L$, $S^{TETE}$, $S^{TTTB}_L$, $S^{TBTB}$ \todo{that we presently ignore as negligible - need to confirm this?}.

We also show the bias, $\Delta\Alens$ in the inferred lensing power spectrum amplitude $\Alens$, which we approximate as 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta\Alens = \frac{\sum_L \sigma^{-2}_L \Delta \Clhatphi{L}\Clphi{L}}{\sum_L  (\Clphi{L}/\sigma_L)^2}
\end{equation}
for the case of a diagonal covariance matrix on $\Clhatphi{L}$ with diagonal elements $\sigma_L$, and true signal $\Clphi{L}$.
The uncertainty on $\Alens$ is given by $\left(\sum_L  (\Clphi{L}/\sigma_L)^2\right)^{-0.5}$, so 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta\Alens}{\sigma(\Alens)} =
    \frac{\sum_L \sigma^{-2}_L \Delta \Clhatphi{L}\Clphi{L}}{\sqrt{\sum_L  (\Clphi{L}/\sigma_L)^2}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Baseline Analysis}

In the baseline power spectrum analysis of \citet{dr6-lensing-auto,dr6-lensing-cosmo}, we perform lensing reconstruction on a weighted coadd the 90 and 150 GHz maps, with each frequency $i$ weighted by the inverse of its 1-dimensional harmonic-space noise power spectrum, $N_l^i$ as estimated from simulations. The coadd is filtered diagonally in harmonic space using the total power spectrum $C_l^{\mathrm{tot},i} = C_l^{\mathrm{cmb}}+N_l^i$, the sum of a fiducial CMB power spectrum and the noise power spectrum, before being passed into the quadratic estimator. 

We perform these same steps on the simulated foreground-only maps used to estimate foreground biases here i.e. we use the same $l$-dependent weights to coadd frequencies, and the same filtering of the maps entering the quadratic estimator (rather than e.g. using the total power spectrum of the foreground maps themselves, since the aim here is to use the same weighting of CMB temperature modes as used in the real data reconstruction).

The purple lines in left panel of \fig{fig:baseline1} shows the predicted bias to the lensing reconstruction power spectrum from temperature data only, as a fraction of the expected signal, for this baseline setup. For both the \websky\  (solid lines) and S10 (dashed lines) simulations, the biases are within 2\% up to $L=600$, which is where most of the \snr\ of the DR6 measurement will come from (the solid, light grey line indicates the cumulative \snr\ as a function of the maximum $L$ included). The biases are also mostly smaller than the uncertainty on the amplitude of the lensing spectrum, $\sigma(\Alens)$, which 3.5\% for the temperature-only measurement,
